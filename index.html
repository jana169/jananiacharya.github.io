							<h2>Research</h2>
							<p>In 2022, I delved into a research project examining the potential of regional algae species in bioremediation, especially for treating aquaculture wastewater and industrial runoff. By analyzing their nutrient uptake rates, I could determine their effectiveness in mitigating environmental pollutants. This research culminated in a presentation at the Summer Research Academies (SRA) at UCSB.

							<br><br>Building on that, in 2023, I broadened my scope by using satellite data to study the relationship between kelp phenology and phytoplankton blooms. Using R to analyze this data gave me a deeper understanding of the environmental factors influencing their interactions. It was a blend of ecology and data analysis, offering insights into algae's role from local cleanup efforts to broader marine ecosystem dynamics.</br></br>

							<h2>Climate Curriculum</h2>
							<p>In an era where climate change challenges intertwine with socio-economic realities, I designed a curriculum tailored for our unique Indian context. With a significant portion of our nation's population residing in rural areas, often underserved and underprivileged, it becomes crucial to address climate change from an inclusive perspective. My curriculum delves deep into this, covering everything from the basic science of climate change to global justice and policy implications, with a specific focus on local challenges and solutions. Moreover, amidst the negative news cycles that dominate the media, this program aims to instill in students a sense of 'realistic climate optimism,' encouraging them not only to comprehend the gravity of the situation but also to work towards sustainable, equitable solutions.<br><br>

							I'm proud to say that my curriculum has already been integrated within six schools across Bangalore, along with over 44,000 users online! <br><br>

							It has also been selected for presentation at an international climate confluence in August 2024, under the guidance of the advisory council including figures such as Raghunath Anant Mashelkar, former CSIR Director General, Dr. Jyoti Parikh, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and Dr. Sonal Mansingh, a member of the Rajya Sabha (India's upper parliamentary house).</p>

							<h2>AeroLens</h2>
							<p>I spent the summer developing Aero Lens, an air quality assessment tool that leverages AI to analyze photos of one's surroundings. Through a simple image, users receive an instant prediction of the Air Quality Index (AQI), empowering them to make informed decisions about their health and environment. Aero Lens also offers health guidance based on detected AQI levels, making it a vital asset in today's urban landscapes.</p>
